The DT

Matsuo PRP

As IN

ashamed JJ

He PRP

For IN

the DT

It PRP

His PRP$

Matsuo CC

The DT

Matsuo PRP
lifted VBD

Fresh PRP

Even RB
now RB

The DT

When WRB

they PRP

Matsuo PRP

Matsuo ``

He PRP

Only RB
the DT

A DT

While IN

Matsuo VBG

up RB

then RB
he PRP
changed VBD
his PRP$

He PRP

so RB
he PRP

The DT

reverberated ,
in IN

Hush PRP

Like IN

Matsuo PRP
awaited MD

How WRB
stupid JJ

The DT
jungle NN

The DT

Before ``

the DT

its PRP$

insects CD

Matsuo DT
puzzled JJ

grew VBD
anxious JJ
over IN

concluding VBG
that IN

the DT

Five CD

so IN

the DT

abruptly RB

immediately RB
throwing VBG

He PRP

It PRP

He PRP

Matsuo NNP

When WRB

Matsuo CC

The DT

The DT

Matsuo VB

The DT

In IN
