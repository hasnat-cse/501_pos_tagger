The DT

Matsuo PRP

He PRP

For IN

He PRP

It PRP

Matsuo PRP

The DT

A DT

Matsuo PRP

Fresh PRP

Even RB

A DT

with IN

The DT

When WRB

they PRP

Matsuo PRP

Matsuo PRP
repeatedly MD

At IN

he PRP

to TO

into IN

He PRP
decided VBD

with IN

Only RB
the DT

the DT

Because WRB

he PRP

more RB

A DT
spectacle NN

it PRP

While IN
his PRP$

some DT

Matsuo RB
squeezed VBN

up RB

then RB
he PRP
changed VBD
his PRP$
mind NN

He PRP
wanted VBD
the DT
arrogant JJ
marine NN
to TO

so IN
he PRP
aimed VBD

The DT
shot JJ
reverberated NNS
in IN

Hush PRP
followed VBD

Like IN

Matsuo CC
awaited JJ
reaction NN
from IN

jungle NN

How WRB
stupid PRP
to TO

The DT
jungle NN
did VBD
not RB

The DT

Before PRP

the DT

its PRP$
old JJ
normalcy NNS

insects NNS
hummed ,

birds NNS
occasionally RB

Matsuo DT
puzzled NN
and CC
grew VBD
anxious VBN
over IN
the DT
complete JJ
passiveness NNS

concluding CC
that IN
he PRP

the DT
butt NN
of IN

devilish JJ

Five CD

so RB
minutes RB
later RB
the DT

abruptly NNS
pulled VBP

stepped RB
into IN

immediately RB
throwing VB
his PRP$

He PRP
went VBD
into IN
a DT

It PRP

right NN
up RB

he PRP
staggered VBD
in IN
no DT

He PRP
wore VBD
no DT

no DT

he PRP
lurched VBD

Matsuo NNP

When WRB

Matsuo PRP

The DT

The DT

so RB
Matsuo TO
shot VB
him PRP

The DT
marine JJ
spun NNS

In IN
the DT

Matsuo PRP

They PRP

Gradually WRB

The DT

The DT

Matsuo PRP
